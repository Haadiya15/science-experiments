        <h2>Did You Know? </h2>

        <div class="fact">
            <h3>1. Water Can Boil and Freeze at the Same Time!</h3>
            <p>This happens at a special condition called the **triple point**, where temperature and pressure are just right for water to exist as a solid, liquid, and gas at the same time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fact">
            <h3>2. A Day on Venus is Longer than a Year!</h3>
            <p>Venus takes **243 Earth days** to rotate once, but only **225 Earth days** to complete an orbit around the Sun. That means a day on Venus is actually longer than its year!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fact">
            <h3>3. Bananas Are Radioactive!</h3>
            <p>Bananas contain **potassium-40**, a radioactive isotope of potassium. But don’t worry! The radiation is harmless and much lower than everyday background radiation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fact">
            <h3>4. Hot Water Freezes Faster Than Cold Water!</h3>
            <p>This strange phenomenon is called the **Mpemba Effect**. Scientists are still studying why it happens, but one theory is that hot water evaporates faster, reducing the total mass that needs to freeze.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fact">
            <h3>5. There’s Enough DNA in Your Body to Stretch to the Sun and Back!</h3>
            <p>Each human cell contains about **6 feet (1.8 meters)** of DNA. If you unrolled all the DNA in your body, it would stretch **over 93 million miles**—the distance from Earth to the Sun!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fact">
            <h3>6. Honey Never Spoils!</h3>
            <p>Archaeologists have found **3,000-year-old honey** in Egyptian tombs that is still perfectly safe to eat. Honey’s low moisture and high acidity prevent bacteria from growing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fact">
            <h3>7. The Eiffel Tower Grows Taller in Summer!</h3>
            <p>Due to **thermal expansion**, the iron in the Eiffel Tower **expands in heat**, making it **15 cm (6 inches) taller** during summer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fact">
            <h3>8. Octopuses Have Three Hearts!</h3>
            <p>Two hearts pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body. When an octopus swims, the heart that supplies the body actually stops beating!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fact">
            <h3>9. There’s a Planet Where It Rains Molten Glass!</h3>
            <p>Exoplanet **HD 189733b** is so hot and stormy that it **rains molten glass sideways** due to extreme winds over 5,400 mph (8,700 km/h)!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fact">
            <h3>10. Your Stomach Gets a New Lining Every Few Days!</h3>
            <p>The stomach's lining is replaced **every 3–4 days** to prevent it from digesting itself with its strong acids!</p>
